For this we can use [`torch.mm()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.mm) or [`torch.matmul()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.matmul) which is somewhat more complicated and supports broadcasting.

Remember that for matrix multiplications, the number of columns in the first tensor must equal to the number of rows in the second column. Both `features` and `weights` have the same shape, `(1, 5)`. This means we need to change the shape of `weights` to get the matrix multiplication to work.\n",

However, if the new shape results in fewer elements than the original tensor, some elements will be removed from the tensor (but not from memory). If the new shape results in more elements than the original tensor, new elements will be uninitialized in memory. Here I should note that the underscore at the end of the method denotes that this method is performed **in-place**.
